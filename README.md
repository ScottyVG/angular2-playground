### What is Angular 2?
### Section 1 - Lecture 2
#### Angular 2 is a Framework for Creating Single Page Applications (SPA)
##### Traditional Web Applications
```
User {=> } Client { request => , Response <= } Server
svg.com/ { => , <= } Server
svg.com/about { => , <= } Server
svg.com/account { => , <= } Server
```

##### Single Page Applications
```
User { => , <= } Client { request => , Response <= } Server
svg.com/ { => , <= } Server
svg.com/about { => , <= } Client
svg.com/account { => , <= } Server
```

### Creating an Angular 2 Project
### Section 1 - Lecture 3
Install angular cli npm module
```
$ sudo npm install -g angular-cli
$ ng new first-app
```
 ng serve - start up server on angular Applications
 ```
 $ ng serve
 ```
go to browser http://localhost:4200/

### Got Setup Issues (with Angular 2 CLI)?
### Section 1 - Lecture 4
In this course I'll use the CLI. I **recommend using it** as it makes the creation and management of Angular 2 projects very easy.

The CLI still is in beta and therefore it works for most students but some also experience issues. If you got some issues try these steps (use `sudo`  on Mac and Linux):

```
[sudo] npm uninstall -g angular-cli
npm cache clean
[sudo] npm install -g angular-cli@latest
(notice the @latest addition - this might fix your installation issues)
```

To get fast support with any more errors,  make sure to browse Q&A section on the installation video - or google any "angular cli YOUR ERROR MESSAGE" => Chances are high to find a solution to your issue!

But if you still got problems installing it (it still is in beta after all) or want to try out/ use a different setup, you may have a look at the following seed project: https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed

Follow the instructions on this page to set it up and use it. The folder structure follows a similar approach as the CLI - you're going to work in the `src/client/app`  folder (CLI: `src/app` ).

Be aware that you won't be able to use the ng commands (like `ng generate component` ) but as I show and discuss all the files generated by the CLI, that shouldn't be an issue. You'll have to create such files on your own, but you will be able to do so.

If you're using this seed because the CLI doesn't work, you may occasionally check for updates of the CLI (explained in section 16 of this course).

### Editing our First App
### Section 1 - Lecture 5
`first-app/src/app` is where all of the app mainly lives
